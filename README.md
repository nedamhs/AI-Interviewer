## About

**AI-Interviewer** is a project created by students of **UCI CS Capstone Project** and sponsored by **Pairwise AI**. The goal of this project is to create a base prototype of an AI-powered interviewer that can conduct basic early-stage screening interviews. This repository contains the source code for a basic prototype that can be ran on **Zoom**. The main goals of this project are:
- Create a working chat bot that can listen and talk over Zoom.
- Design and implement prompting techniques to create a curated interview for candidates.
- Create an easily integratable codebase

## Setup
This project requires **Docker** and the following required **environment variables**:
| Environmental Variable | Description |
| - | - |
| `OPENAI-API-KEY` | API key for accessing OpenAI API |
| `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` | API key for accessing Deepgram transcription |
| `APP_CLIENT_ID` | Zoom App Client ID for accessing Zoom SDK |
| `APP_CLIENT_SECRET` | Zoom App Client Secret for accessing Zoom SDK |
| `REST_CLIENT_ID` | Zoom Server-To-Server OAuth credential used for accessing Zoom API |
| `REST_CLIENT_SECRET` | Zoom Server-To-Server OAuth credential used for accessing Zoom API |
| `REST_ACCOUNT_ID` | Zoom Server-To-Server OAuth credential used for accessing Zoom API |
| `CALENDLY_API_KEY` | API key for accessing the Zoom meeting link created via Calendly |

After obtaining these variables, place them in a **.env** file in the main level directory. Obtaining the [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/) API Keys can be done through their corresponding websites. Obtaining the Zoom credentials can be done through the [Zoom App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/). After creating a Zoom account, create a **General App** by clicking **Develop** -> **Build App** -> **General App**. Make sure to enable **user:read:zak** in the Scopes. Make sure to also enable **Meeting SDK** in Embed. After that, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** of the app to your **APP_CLIENT_ID** and **APP_CLIENT_SECRET** environment variables. 

For the REST environment variables, create a **Server-To-Server OAuth** app in a similar way you would build the general app. Make sure to give your Server-To-Server App the **scopes** for all **Meeting** methods and **User** methods. Then, copy the corresponding variables to your .env file.

For the Calendly integrated version, first create a Calendly account and create a Calendly event, selecting **Zoom** as its **location**. Once an interview is scheduled via calendly, its zoom link can be accessed via Calendly API. The Calendly API key can be accessed from [here](https://calendly.com/integrations/api_webhooks).

## Running

A Docker image is provided for deploying the Zoom chat bot on your own device. The building steps are as follows:

Apply database migrations:
```shell
python manage.py migrate
```
Build docker image:
```shell
docker compose build
```
To run:
```shell
docker compose run --rm develop # Enters the shell of docker container
```
Inside the docker container: 

- Standard mode (instantly creates Zoom meeting and joins):
  
  ```shell
  python ai-interviewer/test_interview.py 
  ```
- Calendly mode (joins a Zoom meeting created by Calendly):
  
  ```shell
  python ai-interviewer/test_interview.py --calendly
  ```
To run the chat bot as a text based conversation in your terminal, run: (You will need to install requirements first if local)
```shell
python ai-interviewer/test_interview.py --terminal 
```
To view the HR Report for previous interviews, run:
```shell
python manage.py runserver
```
